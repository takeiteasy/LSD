# graphics.h

Cross platform software rendering library, inspired by [SDL 1.2](https://www.libsdl.org/), [graphics.h](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1126/materials/cppdoc/graphics.html), [minifb](https://github.com/emoon/minifb) and [QuickCG](http://lodev.org/cgtutor/). It was initially forked from [minifb](https://github.com/emoon/minifb), but has evolved beyond.

Designed to be a drop-in and use with little hassle sort of deal. I don't know if anyone will really find a use for this besides me. But it's very fun to work on. It's not explicitly a game development library, but that'll be the most likely one. It's most likely less efficient, slower, more buggy and has less features, support, compatibility and portability than SDL - Just so you know, if you didn't already guess.


## Features

- OSX (Carbon, OpenGL, Metal), Windows (GDI, OpenGL, DirectX 9), Linux (X11, OpenGL) (so far, see project page for planned stuff).
- Multiple Windows
- Keyboard, mouse and window events.
- Text rendering via in-built font (adapted from [dhepper/font8x8](https://github.com/dhepper/font8x8)) or BDF files
- BMP (24 or 32 bpp uncompressed)
- Message box & dialog support (adapted from [AndrewBelt/osdialog](https://github.com/AndrewBelt/osdialog))


See below screenshots, and check out the examples folder for some idea of how to use. ___Still a WIP, API subject to change a lot___. For documentation, visit [the docs page](https://takeiteasy.github.io/hal/).  Also, see the projects tab for an idea of progress, planned features and ideas.

OS X will be the primary platform for all stuff, then after that is working to a level I like I will finish the windows port and after that the linux port. It's too much effort changing something on OS X then doing it on other platforms all the time. __At the moment Windows & Linux won't build__ (because I removed them).


## Building

No external libraries are used unless you want to use the alternate backends. I don't know how to make CMake files yet so backends will have to be defined manually. You can enable or disable features using macros, there will be a list when everything is closer to being done.

On OS X you'll have to link Cocoa framework ```-framework Cocoa``` and include the ```-x objective-c -fno-objc-arc``` flags. If you're using OpenGL backend ```-framework OpenGL``` and ```-framework Metal -framework MetalKit``` for Metal. Also, if you're using XCode you'll also have to disable modules in the build settings, becuase modules imports curses with stdio for some reason.

**NOTE**: On OS X 10.14, something changed and CoreGraphics isn't working like it used to. So if you're using 10.14 Metal is now the default rending backend. See above.

On Linux you'll have to link libX11 and libm ```-lX11 -lm```, and if you're using the OpenGL backend include ```-ld -lGL```. **NOTE**: X11 can't automatically strech stuff being rendered like ```StretchDIBits``` and ```CGContextDrawImage``` can - so resizing the window is disabled (_until I can find a solution_) unless you're using the OpenGL backend.

On Windows (Visual Studio) you'll have to add ```/utf-8``` to the command line options or unicode decoding won't work properly. I don't know why, but it doesn't.

**Tested on** (so far):
- OS X 10.12, 10.13 & 10.14 (clang)
- Windows 7 x64 (MSVC)
-  Ubuntu 19 x86_64 (Linux 4.13.0-16) (Inside VM only) (clang)

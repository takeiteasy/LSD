# graphics.h

Cross platform 2D software rendering graphics library, inspired by [SDL1.2](https://www.libsdl.org/) and [QuickCG](http://lodev.org/cgtutor/)

Keyboard and mouse events, line, rect, circle primitives, BMP loading (1, 4, 8, 24 & 32 bpp) and internal font rendering adapted from [dhepper/font8x8](https://github.com/dhepper/font8x8).

See ```test.c``` for TODO list and basic example. Still a WIP, API subject to change a lot.
